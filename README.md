* ## Structure & Mockup Designs

After searching the internet for similar sites, I started gathering ideas on elements that I felt that worked well for a gym website and also element that I would like to create on this site.
I used Adobe XD to generate my mockup design as I felt that it would help to display how the colours and elements work together. I also felt by generating a more detailed mockup that includes some
of the text data and images, it would help speed my coding process up and prevent having to stop each time to find images etc. I felt this was a great help as it meant I could keep focused on the coding instead of the content.

I designed mockups for web,tablet and mobile in order to see how I can expect the layout to change when being displayed on different platforms.

* Customer Reviews
    I needed a nice looking section where the customer reviews could be placed and I came across one on the [bootdey website](https://www.bootdey.com/snippets/view/Customer-Reviews#html)
    I've used the code on the membership page, and its main purpose is to help those who are unsure of joining to go-ahead and sign up.


* Gradient On Images
    I had placed some images that had text on top of them and I thought the contrast between the text and the image was very poor and difficult to read.
    To improve this, I was looking to change the opacity of the image or add a layer of transparent black above the image to darken it. 
    I found a soltion to my problem by adding a gradient overlay to a background image taken from the following [website](https://webdevetc.com/blog/how-to-add-a-gradient-overlay-to-a-background-image-using-just-css-and-html/)
