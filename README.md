* ## Design

* ### Structure & Mockup Designs

    After searching the internet for similar sites, I started gathering ideas on elements that I felt that worked well for a gym website and also element that I would like to create on this site.
    I used Adobe XD to generate my mockup design as I felt that it would help to display how the colours and elements work together. I also felt by generating a more detailed mockup that includes some
    of the text data and images, it would help speed my coding process up and prevent having to stop each time to find images etc. I felt this was a great help as it meant I could keep focused on the coding instead of the content.

    I designed mockups for web,tablet and mobile in order to see how I can expect the layout to change when being displayed on different platforms.

* ### Colour scheme   
    <details>
    <summary>In order to make sure I chose a compatible and effective selection of colours, I chose to use Adobe Color to help me with my design.</summary>
    <br>
    <center><img src="./assets/images/readme-color-thefitnesscentre.jpeg" alt="The Fitness Centre - Adobe Color Scheme"></center>
    </details>

* ### Typography 
    I think the font plays a big part in the first impressions of the website and i was looking for something that was quite minimal and modern.
    After looking through the google font library i chose the following:

    The main font is Lato [Link](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=Lato)
    
    The secondary font is Roboto [Link](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=Roboto)

----

* ## Media

* ### Images

    I sourced the images for the website from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/) [Pexels]{https://www.pexels.com/}
    [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/). I chose to out-source the imaging to ensure the highest quality of images and also to make sure that I
    had a large selection of images to choose from.

    * #### Logo
        The logo for the page was designed myself using Adobe Illustrator. I tried to impliment the color scheme of the page in the logo and also
        the fonts to create an image that would blend into the site.

    * #### Hero Image
        I decided to create a hero image for the homepage because I felt it was important to have a big impact on visitors as soon as they reach the site.
        The image I used didn't fit very well as the person in the image was centralised. So I edited the file in Adobe Photoshop so that I could place the
        person to the right, giving me space to have a tagline on the otherside to help generate interest.

* ### Video

    There is only one video on the site. I chose to add a video to the classes page to give the user a taste of what the classes are like at the gym.
    I chose a video that was quite fast moving, motivating and not too long. The video was out sourced from youtube and embedded using an iFrame.

----

* ## Features

* ### Noteable Features

    Here are a few features that help meet the user's expectations when visiting the site:

    *   <b>Eyecatching Content</b> - High Impact Hero Image as a landing page / Automated or manually controlled carousel to promote the gym facilities.

    *   <b>Responsive layout</b> - Designed with compatibility in mind, the site will display well with most popular devices

    *   <b>Colourful and synchronised design</b> 

    *   <b>Online Booking</b> - Members are able to view and book classes online

    *   <b>Become a member online</b> - New and retuning users can join the gym online with a choice of membership packages.

    *   <b>Key Information</b> - Detailed information about the trainers at the gym and their specialities formatted to reduce 
                                 reading time but deliver key information.

    *   <b>Social Media Links</b> - As social media platforms are key areas to help engage with customers, there are social icons 
                                    in the footer of everypage to make sure they are easy for the user to find.

    *   <b>Banners</b> - The site has 'free trial' banners and buttons that blend in well with the site to help generate new members. 
                          A key design feature was to make sure they don't look as external marketing adverts.

    *   <b>The Gym's Location</b> - The footer has all the information required to find or contact the gym. 
                                    Users can click a link to show a map of where the gym is located.

    *   <b>Reviews and Testimonials</b> - The site has 2 sections to find out what other members think of the gym. 
                                          Both located at key areas to help members decide to join the gym.

    *   <b>Ask a Question</b> - Users are able to contact the gym using a 'contact' button within the navigation bar.

* ### Future Features

    *   <b>Social Media Feed</b> - I think it would be useful to have a social media feed so that members can see the social activity 
                                 at the gym without leaving the site.

    *   <b>Online Classes</b> - With gym's having to close down due a pandemic, I think it would be useful to include online classes 
                                on the site so that members can continue to interact if lockdown restrictions forces the gym to close again.

    *   <b>Online Payments</b> - As members would currently have to pay their membership on arrival after signing up online. 
                                 It would be useful to be able to take the membership payments online.

    *   <b>Merchandise/Online Store</b> - Having an online store could be an extra source of income for the gym. 
                                          The store could sell fitness clothing/nutrition and supplements. This could also be very useful to members.

* ### User Stories
    This section is designed to generate possible scenarios of the typical end user that would use this website.
    This will help ensure end user requirements are designed into the website.

    -   I regularly work out at the local gym, and often forget the timetable for the classes. 
        It would be useful to know the schedule for the classes, and if i could book them online?

        <details>
        <summary>To make sure that users are able to access a timetable of classes, I incoporated an online schedule.</summary>
        <br>
        <center><img src="./assets/images/screenshot-classes.png" alt="The Fitness Centre - Class Schedules"></center>
        </details>

    -   As my computer skill aren't great, I would like to be able to easily navigate the site and I really don't
        enjoy filling out large forms.

        <details>
        <summary>The navigation bar was designed to be minimal, yet have access to the most important areas. 
        I also made sure that the forms were minimal, as large forms tend to put off end users </summary>
        <br>
        <center><img src="./assets/images/screenshot-navigation.png" alt="The Fitness Centre - Navigation & Form Example"></center>
        </details>

    -   I take my training quite seriously, and it would be important for me to be able to find out more about the instructors
        available at the gym so I can choose the most appropriate instructor to support my training.

        <details>
        <summary>The instructors play a big part in how enjoyable and rewarding a training session can be.
        Instead of having a large amount of text, I designed their attributes in a graphic format to make the content quick and easy to read.</summary>

* ## Deployment

*   ### GitHub Pages

    The site is hosted on GitHub pages. Deploying the site was very easy to do, especially as the repositry was already installed and managed on GitHub.

    I deployed my site during a mentor session and had my mentor guide me through the process. 
    To deploy the site I carried out the following steps:
        - <b>Go To</b> your [GitHub](www.github.com) repository,
        -    In the top right corner <b>Click Settings</b>
        - <b>Scroll Down</b> to GitHub Pages
        - <b>Select</b> Main/Master branch from the dropdown menu.
        - <b>Click Save</b>

    A link will be generated for your live site.
    Initially all the content had not loaded correctly onto the site. After a force reload on my browser, the site displayed correctly.

* ## Problems 

    <b>Card Wrapping</b>
    During a session with my mentor, we were looking through my site and some of the responsive area's that needed addressing.
    In the classes section, we came across a button that would overlap the wrapping within the card.
    We used inspect tool within Google Chrome to see what could be causing the problem. It was very difficult to find the issue as there was only
    3 out of the 6 cards that had the issue (despite all of the code for each one being the same).

    My mentor suggested we could use a 'Clearfix' class to help address the problem. Initially when we applied the class, there was no change and 
    we thought it was because of a newer version of Bootsrap. However it turned out that using Clearfix was not going to be the solution.

    I then found that the problem could be resolved using a media query specifically targeting the height of the cards.

    The media query would apply the Bootstrap H-20 class for browsers with a min-width of 768px, for anything below that min-width then it would remove the
    class. This meant that the button would wrap correctly and display on both browser width.

    <b>Deployment</b>
    When deploying my site to the GitHub pages, the deployed site did not show any CSS styling or images.
    I worked out that the reason for this would be either the files were not in the server or the addressing was incorrect.
    It turned out that the source addressing for the images and css were written in Absolute Paths.
    After changing all of the paths to Relative Paths, the site functioned correctly.

* ## Testing

*   ###  HTML
    I used [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) website to validate my code.
    I used the online version, inputted my git pages link and it ran through its tests.
    At first when I looked at the report I was quite concerned that there were so many errors. However, the first 50 errors were all pointing towards one area.
    The error had generated an error message for every character within the tag as I had missed a " in the description meta tag. I added the character and it cleared all of the errors associated with that item.
    A repeating error that came up was that there were a number of stray div tags and the validator was a useful tool to help locate and remove the div tags.

*   ###  CSS
    I used [Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/)
    I uploaded the style.css file to the site in order for it to carry out the validation checks. 
    There were a number of errors in relation to typing errors and missing ';' however the checks found an error with some gradient colours I had set up to display in the background.
    The code for the gradient colour I used was formatted in rgba format and the validator marked this as an error. Once I changed the values to hex format, there were no further errors.

*   ###  Website compatibility

    As end users can view the site on many different platforms, devices and browsers of all screen width, I felt it was important to test my site's performance on as many devices as I could.
    I carried out tests on the following devices:

    *   Apple iPhone 12
    *   Apple iPad
    *   Samsung Galaxy Phone 
    *   iMac 
    *   Lenovo Laptop
    *   Chrome Browser
    *   Internet Explorer
    *   Microsoft Edge

    The site performed well on all of the above platforms. I noticed there were slight variations in some of the elements, but did not find any problems that would effect the end user experience.

*   ###  Link Testing

    I ran manual tests myself, running through all the pages and all the links on each page.
    This was to ensure that all the links and buttons work as they should and takes the end user to the correct place.

* ## Credits

*   ###  Code

    *   Customer Reviews
        I needed a nice looking section where the customer reviews could be placed and I came across one on the [bootdey website](https://www.bootdey.com/snippets/view/Customer-Reviews#html)
        I've used the code on the membership page, and its main purpose is to help those who are unsure of joining to go-ahead and sign up.

    *   Gradient On Images
        I had placed some images that had text on top of them and I thought the contrast between the text and the image was very poor and difficult to read.
        To improve this, I was looking to change the opacity of the image or add a layer of transparent black above the image to darken it. 
        I found a solution to my problem by adding a gradient overlay to a background image taken from the following [website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp)

*   ###  Images/Video

    The images I used for the site were sourced from the following sites and photographers.
